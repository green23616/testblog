# Overall Plan - Test Blog Project

## Project Overview
**Purpose**: Sample implementation of a developer blog to validate the architecture before building the production version.

**Tech Stack**:
- Next.js 16.0.7 with App Router
- React 19.2.0
- TypeScript 5.9
- TailwindCSS 3.4.18
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)
- Shadcn/ui components

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
**Goal**: Set up base Next.js project with core dependencies
- ✅ Next.js 16.0.7 + React 19.2.0 + TypeScript
- ✅ TailwindCSS 3.4.18 configuration
- ✅ Basic app structure (src/ directory)
- ✅ Build verification
- 🔄 Next: Install Shadcn/ui, Zod, Lucide icons
- 🔄 Next: Initialize Git repository with proper structure

**Expected Duration**: Day 1

---

### Phase 2: Supabase Integration ✅
**Goal**: Database setup and blog functionality
- ✅ Database schema creation (posts, tags, comments)
- ✅ Supabase client configuration (server & browser)
- ✅ Server Actions for CRUD operations
- ✅ Basic blog listing and post pages
- ❌ Rich text editor integration (deferred - using textarea)
- ❌ Image upload to Supabase Storage (deferred to Phase 5)

**Expected Duration**: Day 2-3
**Actual**: Completed December 12, 2025

---

### Phase 3: Admin Dashboard & CMS ✅
**Goal**: Content management system for admins
- ✅ Admin dashboard with statistics
- ✅ Posts management (create, edit, delete)
- ✅ Tags management (create, delete)
- ✅ Comment moderation system
- ✅ Auto-slug generation
- ✅ SEO metadata fields
- ⚠️ No authentication (test project only)
- ⚠️ No image upload (deferred to Phase 5)

**Expected Duration**: Day 4-5
**Actual**: Completed December 12, 2025

---

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization ✅
**Goal**: User experience and SEO enhancements
- ✅ Dark mode with KST auto-switching
- ✅ Public comments system
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Dynamic metadata (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- ✅ Sitemap generation
- ✅ Structured data (JSON-LD)
- ✅ Error boundaries and loading states
- ❌ Analytics integration (deferred)
- ❌ Related posts (deferred)

**Expected Duration**: Day 6-7
**Actual**: Completed December 12, 2025

---

### Phase 5: Image Upload ✅ (Unplanned)
**Goal**: Featured image functionality with Supabase Storage
- ✅ Supabase Storage bucket setup
- ✅ ImageUploader component with validation
- ✅ Featured image display on posts
- ✅ Image thumbnails on blog list
- ✅ Next.js Image optimization
- ✅ Alt text for accessibility
- ✅ RLS policies (permissive for test project)
- ✅ Validation schema fix (Phase 5.1)

**Reason for Separate Phase**: Deferred from Phase 2/3 to avoid scope creep, implemented as dedicated feature phase
**Actual**: Completed December 12, 2025

## GitHub Workflow

### Repository Setup
- Semantic versioning (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, etc.)
- Labels for organization:
  - `priority: high/medium/low`
  - `area: frontend/backend/database`
  - `type: feature/bug/docs`

### Commit Strategy
- Push after each phase completion
- Code review before merge
- Tag releases with version numbers

### Documentation
- Phase reports in `documents/` folder
- Brief summaries of work completed
- Issues encountered and solutions
- Key decisions and rationale

---

## Key Decisions

### Architecture
- **App Router over Pages Router**: Better for RSC and modern Next.js patterns
- **Server Actions over API Routes**: Simpler data mutations, better TypeScript support
- **Supabase over custom backend**: Faster development, managed infrastructure

### Styling
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first, consistent design system
- **Shadcn/ui**: Pre-built accessible components
- **Pretendard Font**: Korean language support with clean aesthetics

### State Management
- **React Server Components**: Default for data fetching
- **Client Components**: Only for interactive features
- **No global state library**: Keep it simple initially

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Phase 1**: Project builds without errors, dev server runs
✅ **Phase 2**: Database configured, blog pages functional
✅ **Phase 3**: Admin can create/edit posts, manage tags and comments
✅ **Phase 4**: Users can read posts, leave comments, search content, dark mode works
✅ **Phase 5**: Admin can upload images, featured images display on posts
⏳ **Future**: Analytics integration, related posts, performance optimization

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues**:
1. Next.js 16 with Turbopack may have edge cases → Test thoroughly
2. Supabase RLS policies need careful configuration → Review security
3. Image optimization settings require tuning → Monitor bundle size
4. Dark mode edge cases in Safari → Cross-browser testing

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Test each feature immediately after implementation
- Incremental commits for easy rollback
- Documentation of issues and solutions
- Regular builds to catch breaking changes early

---

## Notes
- This is a **test implementation** - lessons learned will inform the production build
- Focus on **validating architecture decisions** over pixel-perfect design
- **Document everything** - especially what doesn't work as expected
- Keep the scope **realistic and achievable** within the timeline

---

## Current Status

**Phases Completed**: 5 of 4 planned (Phase 5 was unplanned addition)
**Version**: v0.5.0
**Last Commit**: Phase 5.1 - Image validation fix

### Deferred Features
- Rich text editor (using basic textarea)
- Admin authentication (test project only)
- Analytics integration
- Related posts functionality
- Performance optimization (ISR fine-tuning, bundle analysis)
- Pagination for blog list

### Next Phase Options
1. **User Engagement**: Related posts, reading progress indicator, social sharing
2. **Analytics & Monitoring**: Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics, error tracking
3. **Performance**: Bundle optimization, ISR tuning, Lighthouse audit to >90
4. **Advanced Features**: RSS feed, newsletter signup, code syntax highlighting
5. **Production Prep**: Authentication, deployment configuration, monitoring setup
