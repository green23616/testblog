# Overall Plan - Test Blog Project

## Project Overview
**Purpose**: Sample implementation of a developer blog to validate the architecture before building the production version.

**Tech Stack**:
- Next.js 16.0.7 with App Router
- React 19.2.0
- TypeScript 5.9
- TailwindCSS 3.4.18
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)
- Shadcn/ui components

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
**Goal**: Set up base Next.js project with core dependencies
- ✅ Next.js 16.0.7 + React 19.2.0 + TypeScript
- ✅ TailwindCSS 3.4.18 configuration
- ✅ Basic app structure (src/ directory)
- ✅ Build verification
- 🔄 Next: Install Shadcn/ui, Zod, Lucide icons
- 🔄 Next: Initialize Git repository with proper structure

**Expected Duration**: Day 1

---

### Phase 2: Supabase & CMS
**Goal**: Database setup and admin dashboard for content management
- Database schema creation (posts, tags, comments)
- Supabase client configuration (server & browser)
- Server Actions for CRUD operations
- Admin dashboard UI
- Rich text editor integration
- Image upload to Supabase Storage

**Expected Duration**: Day 2-3

---

### Phase 3: Public Features
**Goal**: User-facing blog functionality
- Blog listing page with pagination
- Individual blog post pages
- Comments system
- View counter
- Search functionality
- Related posts
- Dark mode implementation

**Expected Duration**: Day 4-5

---

### Phase 4: SEO & Polish
**Goal**: Production-ready optimization
- Dynamic metadata (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- Sitemap generation
- Structured data (JSON-LD)
- Performance optimization (ISR, image optimization)
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Analytics integration

**Expected Duration**: Day 6-7

---

## GitHub Workflow

### Repository Setup
- Semantic versioning (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, etc.)
- Labels for organization:
  - `priority: high/medium/low`
  - `area: frontend/backend/database`
  - `type: feature/bug/docs`

### Commit Strategy
- Push after each phase completion
- Code review before merge
- Tag releases with version numbers

### Documentation
- Phase reports in `documents/` folder
- Brief summaries of work completed
- Issues encountered and solutions
- Key decisions and rationale

---

## Key Decisions

### Architecture
- **App Router over Pages Router**: Better for RSC and modern Next.js patterns
- **Server Actions over API Routes**: Simpler data mutations, better TypeScript support
- **Supabase over custom backend**: Faster development, managed infrastructure

### Styling
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first, consistent design system
- **Shadcn/ui**: Pre-built accessible components
- **Pretendard Font**: Korean language support with clean aesthetics

### State Management
- **React Server Components**: Default for data fetching
- **Client Components**: Only for interactive features
- **No global state library**: Keep it simple initially

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Phase 1**: Project builds without errors, dev server runs
⏳ **Phase 2**: Admin can create/edit posts with images
⏳ **Phase 3**: Users can read posts, leave comments, search content
⏳ **Phase 4**: Lighthouse score >90, proper SEO metadata

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues**:
1. Next.js 16 with Turbopack may have edge cases → Test thoroughly
2. Supabase RLS policies need careful configuration → Review security
3. Image optimization settings require tuning → Monitor bundle size
4. Dark mode edge cases in Safari → Cross-browser testing

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Test each feature immediately after implementation
- Incremental commits for easy rollback
- Documentation of issues and solutions
- Regular builds to catch breaking changes early

---

## Notes
- This is a **test implementation** - lessons learned will inform the production build
- Focus on **validating architecture decisions** over pixel-perfect design
- **Document everything** - especially what doesn't work as expected
- Keep the scope **realistic and achievable** within the timeline
